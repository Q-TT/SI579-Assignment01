      <h2>Quick intro about me</h2>
      <p>I’m a Master's student at the University of Michigan. I’m currently doing a triple degree, which is focusing on UX research and Design. Landscape Architecture and Environmental Informatics. My priority is definitely UX design because I have a huge passion for that. Growing up, I have always been loving the beauty of arts and the logic of science. And my education background does support me both solid design skills and technical skills. UX is one of the most collaborative subjects that merges art, design, human behavior, and technology into a single unit of work. Such a seamless combination of art and technology allows me to build both sides of the muscles.
